## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import dataset
2. Check for null and duplicate values
3. Assign x and y values
4. Split data into train and test data
5. Import logistic regression and fit the training data
6. Predict y value
7. Calculate accuracy and confusion matrix

## Program:
```
